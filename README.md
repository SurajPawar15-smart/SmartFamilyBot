# Dialogflow

Using Dialogflow, users can design and integrate conversational user interfaces into their mobile apps, web applications, devices, bots, interactive voice response systems, and related uses. 
In a conversation, end-user text or audio is transcribed into structured data so your apps and services can process it.In order for your system to work, you need to design and implement a Dialogflow agent.Â An agent in Dialog flow is similar to an agent in a call center. With Dialogflow, you can build AI conversational agents without having to code, thanks to Cloud Speech-to-Text. Dialogflow is one of the most well-crafted AI platforms.
